EDIT: GNARR! New Anvil file format invalidates this tool entirely. I could 
fix it, but I'm not planning on it.


This repo contains Racket code for reading/writing minecraft .mcr files.
It includes a command-line interface, minecraft-cli.rkt.

To build an executable, run

raco exe -o mcr-tool minecraft-cli.rkt

... and then run

mcr-tool --help

for help on the options.
